# Astar-Path-Finding-Visualization

This project contains a visualization of how the Astar algorithm finds the shortest path to the goal. The code was built on a windows machine running python 3.7.4.

## Requirements
Python 3
```bash
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```
pygame
```bash
pip install pygame
```
tkinter
```bash
pip install tkinter
```

## Usage

The user will first have to enter the start and goal positions. The coordinates will be taken in the multiple of 25. Once clicked on submit, the user can draw obstructions for the algorithm by dragging the mouse onto the grid. On clicking the space button, the algorithm will start execution.
